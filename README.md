### Hello!

- I am William Lin!
- I am pursuing a Master's Degree in Computer Science at the University of Minnesota Twin Cities in the Fall.
- I am currently working on a Todo List App with a Rust API Backend and (hopefully) React Native as the UI Frontend!
- I am interested in learning and exploring many different concepts and ideas in computer science!
  - I seek to explore various current and new technologies: studying and implementing current industry practices within my own projects.

A project that I am currently working on is a todo list that seeks to add features that I have not seen in other todo list out there.
- In this project, I explore implementing a REST-ful API in Axum web server library in Rust and implementing OAuth 2.0 with JWTs.
